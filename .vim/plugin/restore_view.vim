"   Description: 
"       This is a simple script to autosave cursor position and fold
"       information using vim's mkview.  Although you can easily do this job by
"       just add serveral line to {.,_}vimrc, write a script plugin can make it
"       more clean and nice.  We assume you use a new enough Vim to enjoy
"       these feature. Hope you love it:)
"
"       Views will be saved when you save/write a file or EXIT VIM.
"
" Suggested Setting:
"       Please put them in you vimrc file.
"           set viewoptions=cursor,folds,slash,unix
"       
"       Set it in a plugin file looks dirty to me.  So you'd better do it your
"       self.  This only keywords not in viewoptions is "options". I believe it
"       does not belong to a view.  If you think you need it, feel free to
"       put it in.  If you do not want views of some files to be saved, please
"       set g:loaded_restore_view. The longer time you use, the bigger view
"       folder you will have.  So if you use UNIX environment, you may need to
"       use cron to do some clean job.
