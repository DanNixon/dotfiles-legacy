## Command tmux-setup

In the purpose of always making debugging sessions easier while being more
effective, `GEF` integrates two commands:

  * `tmux-setup`
  * `screen-setup`

Those commands will check whether GDB is being spawn from inside a `tmux`
(resp. `screen`) session, and if so, will split the pane vertically, and
configure the context to be redirected to the new pane, looking something like:

To set it up, simply enter
```
gefâž¤ tmux-setup
```

**Note**: Although `screen-setup` provides a similar setup, the structure of
`screen` does not allow a very clean way to do this. Therefore, if possible, it
would be recommended to use the `tmux-setup` command instead.
