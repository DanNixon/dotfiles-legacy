  changed die to warn when unexpectedly unable to remove a snapshot - this
  allows sanoid to continue taking/removing other snapshots not affected by
  whatever lock prevented the first from being taken or removed

sanoid (1.4.16) unstable; urgency=medium

  * merged @hrast01's extended fix to support -o option1=val,option2=val passthrough to SSH. merged @JakobR's
  * off-by-one fix to stop unnecessary extra snapshots being taken under certain conditions. merged @stardude900's
  * update to INSTALL for FreeBSD users re:symlinks. Implemented @LordAro's update to change DIE to WARN when
  * encountering a dataset with no snapshots and --no-sync-snap set during recursive replication. Implemented
  * @LordAro's update to sanoid.conf to add an ignore template which does not snap, prune, or monitor.
